# Simple Authentication Flow

A simple authentication flow, to learn about NodeJs, TypeORM lib and tests with Vitest.

In this application, you might be able to create an account and connect.
The point is: All the tests should be create before the flow, to test everything and make sure that the flow is running correctly.

As said above, the used libs will be:

- [TypeORM]('https://typeorm.io')
- [Vitest]('https://vitest.dev')

And the I use typescript as the superset
[Typescript]('https://www.typescriptlang.org')
